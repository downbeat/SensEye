# DESCRIPTION

cvEyeTracker is eyetracking software aimed at doing simple dark-pupil eye tracking
from a firewire camera that monitors the eye. The software also supports input
from a second camera to provide a frame of reference of where the eye is looking.

Russ Bielawski and Joe Romeo forked cvEyeTracker in November 2012 to take input from stdin using the Glasses Data Protocol (GDP) v0.
