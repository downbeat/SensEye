This uClinux project can be built with the environment provided by Emcraft for
their Smartfusion SOM.  Documentation is found at
https://www.emcraft.com/products/133#software.  Setup of the environment is
in the "Linux Cortex-M User's Manual" document before attempting to build this
project.

The CodeSourcery compiler download URL is difficult to find.

Before running make, set the environment variable UCLINUX_PROJDIR to this directory.
Running export_UCLINUX_PROJDIR.sh will do this for you.
