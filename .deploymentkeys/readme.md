# Deployment Keys

These deployment keys give read-only access to the Bitbucket repository
``git@bitbucket.org:498glasses/498glasses.git``.

The SSH private key id_rsa__senseye_bitbucket_repo is used to access the SensEye
repository.  See the ``config`` file for an example of adding the host
``senseye_repo`` to your SSH configuration.

See <https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Use+deployment+keys> for
Bitbucket's description of deployment keys.
