===============================================================================
do this  (you need opencv, or just disregard the slew of errors in the
         utilities that need it)
===============================================================================
 - run makeall.sh (unfortunately, for many utils you need OpenCV libs)
 - utilities are put in ./bin


===============================================================================
basic usecases
===============================================================================
Want to capture from some glasses and NOT save the data?
$ glassescapstream | frontdisplayandsave -q

Want to capture from some glasses and save the data?
$ glassescapstream | frontdisplayandsave -o <outputpath>

Want to replay some captured data?
$ glassesreplaystream | frontdisplayandsave [-q|-o ...]


You get the point.  Most utils are front ends and should be attached to a
capture utility or a replay utility as a backend.


===============================================================================
capture utilities
===============================================================================
glassescapstream    - grab data from glasses, pump out frames on stdout
                      (no opencv needed)
glassescapsnapshot  - grab data from glasses one frame at a time, "" ""
                      (no opencv needed)
glassesreplaystream - replay a folder full of pictures and an FPS metadata file


===============================================================================
replay utilities (these all read data from stdin without knowing if its live
                  or replay)
===============================================================================
frontdisplayandsave    - display to the screen and, optionally, save it (as
                         BMPs and an FPS metadata file)
fronteyedetect         - try to detect center of the pupil
gazesetgroundtruth     - replay a set of eye and scene images and the user must
                         click the eyes gaze in each scene image.
frontgazecoordsoverlay - this takes frame data on stdin but needs to read
                         metadata files for gaze locations and bad frames flags
cvEyeTracker           - see http://thirtysixthspan.com/openEyes/software.html
